Introduction

This project is a Python Flask API that acts as a backend fo age and gender detection. It is designed to receive images or video data, process them using the D-VT model, and return the predicted age, gender, and the bounding box of any detected faces.
Features

    API Endpoints: Provides a RESTful API to handle image and video data.

    D-VT Integration: Utilizes the D-VT age and gender detection model on the server-side.

    Flexible Input: Can accept image files directly or be configured for video stream processing.

    JSON Output: Returns results in a structured JSON format, including predicted age, gender, and confidence scores.

Technical Stack
Backend (API)

    Python: The primary programming language for the server.

    Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the REST API.

    D-VT: The age and gender estimation model.

    PyTorch: The machine learning framework used to load and run the D-VT model.

    Other Dependencies: Pillow, Numpy, opencv-python.
